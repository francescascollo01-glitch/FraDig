<h1>Welcome to FraDig</h1>
<p>I am an exchange student from Italy currently spending a semester abroad in Orlando. In Milan, I study languages and digital communication, with a strong interest in how media and technology shape everyday interactions. Back in Italy, I completed a marketing and blogging course where I created my own personal website, gaining hands-on experience with digital content creation and basic website management. I have good language skills, particularly in English and Spanish, and I enjoy working in multicultural environments where I can combine communication, creativity, and adaptability
