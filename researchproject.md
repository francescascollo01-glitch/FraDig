# Abstract

This project utilized the interactive storytelling platform Twine to explore how social media algorithms shape user identity, visibility, and experiences of inequality across digital platforms. The digital narrative followed multiple characters as they navigated algorithmic decisions on apps like TikTok and Instagram, showing how some users adapt, struggle, or are marginalized by invisible systems of curation and recommendation (Cotter; Ionescu and Licu). Drawing on recent scholarship, this project called attention to how algorithms are not neutral—they can reinforce social inequalities (Li and Shi), create new forms of self-perception (Ionescu and Licu), and even affect who gets access to valuable information (Li and Shi). Research further reveals that algorithmic power extends from creative industries to gig work, influencing both everyday self-presentation and economic security (Deng et al.; Rieder et al. 52). By making these dynamics visible and engaging through narrative, the project aimed to raise digital literacy and spark discussion about platform responsibility. Ultimately, this work argues that understanding and critiquing algorithmic systems is essential, not just for technologists, but for anyone invested in equity and self-expression online (Whelan 4).
