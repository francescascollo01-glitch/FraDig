  <h1> Abstract </h1>
  <p>In today’s world, social media has become a constant presence in our daily lives. While it helps us stay connected, research shows that heavy use can negatively affect mental health. For example, Primack et al. (2017) found that young adults who spent more than two hours per day on social networking sites were twice as likely to report feelings of social isolation. For my project, I chose to use Twine in order to create an interactive narrative that explores how everyday choices on social media, like scrolling, posting, or messaging, can lead to very different emotional outcomes. My goal is to show both the risks and the positive possibilities when we become aware of our online habits.</p>
